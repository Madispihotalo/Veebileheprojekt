      <h2> About <em>League of Legends</em> </h2>
      <p> In <em>League of Legends</em>, players assume the role of an unseen "summoner" that controls a "champion" with unique abilities and battle against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions. The goal is usually to destroy the opposing team's "nexus", a structure that lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures, although other distinct game modes exist as well. Each <em>League of Legends</em> match is discrete, with all champions starting off fairly weak but increasing in strength by accumulating items and experience over the course of the game.<br /><br /> The champions and setting blend a variety of elements, including high fantasy, steampunk, and Lovecraftian horror. </p>

      <h2> Gameplay </h2>
      <p> <em>League of Legends</em> is a 3D, third-person multiplayer online battle arena (<strong>MOBA</strong>) game. The game consists of three current running game modes: <strong>Summoner's Rift, Twisted Treeline, and Howling Abyss</strong>. Another game mode, The Crystal Scar, has since been removed. <br /><br />Players compete in matches, lasting anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes on average. In each game mode, teams work together to achieve a victory condition, typically destroying the core building (called <strong>the Nexus</strong>) in the enemy team's base after bypassing a line of defensive structures called turrets, or towers.</p>

      <p> In all game modes, players control characters called champions, chosen or assigned every match, who each have a set of unique abilities. Champions begin every match at a low level, and then gain experience over the course of the match to achieve a maximum level of 18. Gaining champion levels in matches allows players to unlock their champion's special abilities and augment them in a number of ways unique to each character. If a champion loses all their health, they are defeated, but are automatically revived in their base after enough time passes. <br /><br />Players also begin each match with a low amount of gold, and can earn additional gold throughout the match in a variety of ways: by killing non-player characters known as minions and monsters; by killing or helping to kill enemy players; by destroying enemy structures; passively over time; and through unique item interactions or champion abilities. This gold can then be spent throughout the match to buy in-game items that further augment each champion's abilities and game play in a variety of ways. Champion experience, gold earned, and items bought are specific to each match and do not carry over to subsequent matches. Thus, all players begin each match on more-or-less equal footing relative to their opposing team.</p>

      <p> Across matches, players also earn rewards that are applied to their account. Player accounts begin at level one and progress onward with games played. Player level is separate from character level; both a level 30 account and a level 5 account would begin at character level 1 at the start of a new game. From 2009–2017, the maximum account level was 30, and as players progressed, they unlocked additional content and abilities. This system was reworked in November 2017, with the removal of the level 30 limit and removal of a Runes / Masteries system that gave progressive bonuses to players based on their account level. Playing matches and leveling up provides "Blue Essence" (called "Influence Points" (IP) from 2009–2017), a currency that can be used in lieu of "real money" to access certain locked features. </p>

      <p> Accounts are given rankings based on the <strong>Elo rating system</strong>, with proprietary adjustments. These ratings are used in automated matchmaking to make games with players of comparable skill level on each team. </p>
